- Building a competitive full self-play RL is probably not realistic even with free Kaggle notebooks and the `$1000` Google cloud compute credits. It might be possible to use RL in a smarter way. For example, first training a policy to reproduce the behavior of a top player before improving that policy with self-play RL.
