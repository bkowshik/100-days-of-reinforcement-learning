## Observations
- Once a player has the ball, the player does not pass instead tried to run to the goal and then shoot. This is useful when the player is in the middle, but almost useless when the player is on the flanks. Then, the better option is to pass to somebody in the center of the field.
- Player not passing becomes even more important for when a goal keeper gets the ball. We don't want the goal keeper to run to the other end.
